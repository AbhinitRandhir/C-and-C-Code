Polymorphism:-
            Polymorphism is the process of performing the single task in different ways. Polymorphism is the Greek word . In which  ‘poly‘  means many and   ‘morphs ’  means  forms. It means  many forms .
Polymorphism is classified into two types they are-
1.      Static  or Compile time Polymorphism
2.      Dynamic  or Run time  Polymorphism
Runtime Polymorphism:-
            Runtime Polymorphism is also called as Dynamic polymorphism. It is the process of calling the Overriding methods in runtime rather than In compile time.
In  this process  the  overriding methods are called with reference of super class.
Explanation:-
            In the above program we use single inheritance two achieve the runtime polymorphism in our example.
We use two classes here. We call the base class with the reference of  the super class.
 We create different objects to the two classes and call the both base   class   as well as super class with reference of super class only.
So, Runtime polymorphism is achieved here.
